# 🌼 Iris Flower Classification App

This application classifies Iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their sepal and petal measurements. The classification is performed using a Naive Bayes model, and the app is built with Streamlit to provide an interactive web interface.

## 📌 About the Project

This project demonstrates the basics of machine learning classification using the popular Iris dataset. It utilizes a Naive Bayes classifier to make predictions based on input measurements. The goal is to provide a simple, educational app for learning and understanding classification models in machine learning.

## 🚀 Features

- Naive Bayes Classification: Predicts the species of an Iris flower using a trained Naive Bayes model.
- User Input: Allows users to enter custom measurements to get a prediction.
- Data Visualization: Provides plots to help users understand the data distribution and model's decision boundaries.
